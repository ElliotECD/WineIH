After completing the IronHack bootcamp, I ideated and created a project relating to people and their wine preferences. 

I started with a dataset from Kaggle which listed many different characteristics about red and white wines. 

In the beginning of my project, I focused on predicting the quality of wine based on these characteristics. 

Following this, I created an algorithm that accurately predicted whether the wine was red or white. 

In finalizing the project, I made a cluster of algorithms using what I had learned to help people find a wine that best represented their preferences based on another wine that they like.

If you can use Streamlit on your computer, please try out the last two files. It'll give you a better idea of what I've accomplished.
